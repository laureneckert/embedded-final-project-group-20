Embedded final project for Group 20: Lauren Eckert, Jaric Abadinas, Keiran Murphy

# README
This repository contains three pieces of code for a project that controls a DC motor using a microcontroller based on the input from a light sensor. The code is designed for the MSP430fr2355 microcontroller.

# DCMotor.c
This code is responsible for controlling a DC motor using the MSP430fr2355 microcontroller. The motor's speed is adjusted by pressing two buttons (P4.1 and P2.3) to increase or decrease the duty cycle. The motor is driven by a PWM signal generated by Timer_B3 on pin P6.0.

## Functions
- GPIOInit(): Initializes the GPIO pins for the motor and the buttons.
- TimerInit(): Initializes Timer_B3 for generating the PWM signal.
## Interrupts
- Port_2(): Interrupt handler for P2.3 button, decreases duty cycle.
- Port_4(): Interrupt handler for P4.1 button, increases duty cycle.

# EmbeddedProjectDriver.c
This code is the main application driver that controls the DC motor's speed based on the input from a light sensor. It continuously reads data from the light sensor and adjusts the duty cycle of the motor accordingly.

## Functions
- ConfigureAdc_light(): Configures the ADC for reading the light sensor data.
- GPIOInit(): Initializes the GPIO pin for the motor.
- TimerInit(): Initializes Timer_B3 for generating the PWM signal.

# LightSensor.c
This code configures the onboard light sensor on the MSP430fr2355 as an input for the project. It continuously reads data from the light sensor and stores the value in the light variable.

## Functions
- ConfigureAdc_light(): Configures the ADC for reading the light sensor data.

Please refer to the respective code files for a detailed explanation of each line of code.
